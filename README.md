# sniperu

This is an old course sniper I made for Rutgers University as a Discord bot.

This is marked as "source available", not "open source", so don't use any of the code here for your own projects. I don't mind if anyone references it and makes their own for fun.

Also, please don't question `src/utils/discord`.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.16. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
